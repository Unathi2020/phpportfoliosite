    <h3>My journey</h3>
    <p>My coding jouney started in second grade - assembling computers and pluggin in all the correct cables</p>

    <p>Things then got serious in high school when I was introduced to Java and Object oriented programming.</p>


<p>A few years after working in financial sales I decided to level up my skill set and get back into coding and proceeded to get my Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer Certificate</p>
